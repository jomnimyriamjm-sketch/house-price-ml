# 🏠 House Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

This is a beginner machine learning project that predicts house prices using the California Housing dataset.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a regression model to predict median house prices based on socio-economic and geographic features.

## 📊 Dataset
- California Housing Dataset (from scikit-learn)
- Features include:
  - Median income
  - House age
  - Number of rooms
  - Population

## 🧠 Model Used
- Linear Regression

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Python
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## 📈 Results
The model achieves reasonable performance for a baseline regression model.
Evaluation metrics used:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Try Random Forest or Gradient Boosting
- Feature scaling
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model comparison
